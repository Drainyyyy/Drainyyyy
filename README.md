## WelcomeðŸ‘‹
to my GitHub page. There's not much on here, and I'm not very active in programming, but you can still see most of my Projects.

## Who is Drainyyy?
Yes it's actually Drainyyy with _just_ 3y's. But the GitHub usename Drainyyy was already taken.

Long story short, I am a hobby developer from germany, who is interested in IT security (not much projects on this profile, that cover this interest). Along with the other information in this README, this should be a good summary of myself. If you want to learn more about me, visit [my website](https://drainyyy.xyz).

### What to find here
As I mentioned, there's not much you can find. But I can tell you about the few things that are one here. Most of my stuff is written in python. And you can find the code for my Discord bot on here (probably one of the very few projects that are "finished").

I also like to make useful libraries for programmers (see e.g. [minimalLog](https://github.com/Drainyyyy/minimalLog)).

### License
I am a fan of using other ones code. But there have to be rules and that's defined in the license. Most of the time I use the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), just because I think that it's prety fair. But no matter which license I use, please do not violate against it's specifications.

### Contact / Support
If you want to contact me, you can contact me via all the linked ways on [my website](https://drainyyy.xyz/contact). This includes Discord, Email and maybe more. When reporting something like a bug, please make sure to give me enough information to understand what you mean. But you can also contact me if you only have one question.

### Status
You can check the status of each project on the respective GitHub page / the project page on my website (can be outdated / not added (oops)). If you want to know the status and it's not shown at any project page, just contact me.
